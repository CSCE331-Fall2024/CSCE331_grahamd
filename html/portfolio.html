          <h2>THE PROBLEM</h2>
          <p>
            The art and self-help communities I associate myself with want tools
            to make learning and habit-tracking easier. I need more projects to
            learn web development.
          </p>
          <h2>THE SOLUTION</h2>
          <p>
            I can use my experience in programming to make tools for the
            communities that I associate myself with.
          </p>
          <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
          <p>
            KavTools is an ongoing project to make tools for the art communities
            that I am apart of and to gain more experience in web development.
            If I am able to craft tools that solve problems in art
            comprehension, then I am able to simultaneously solve those problems
            for myself and others.
          </p>
          <p>
            The project originally began in Unity, but I later realized that it
            had to be done in JavaScript, or at least some other language more
            closely related to web development. I then found
            <a
              href="https://threejs.org/"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >Three.js</a
            >, a library for displaying 3D environments in browser. While it was
            a pretty heavy learning curve, it was extremely fun to experiment
            with.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was originally doing all of the intersection logic, by hand, using
            my knowledge from Calculus 3 and Linear Algebra. This was
            painstaking, and I eventually found
            <a
              href="https://github.com/gkjohnson/three-bvh-csg"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >three-bvh-csg</a
            >, an intuitive three.js library that could optimally handle the
            math of calculating the intersection between primitives.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here are some of the tools and games that I want to implement by the
            end of this year:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Intersection Tool:</b> A tool for visualizing intersections
              between primitive objects.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Box Tool:</b> A tool for manipulating the vanishing points of
              boxes, as well as having a step-by-step drawing mode.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Pose Tool:</b> Using machine vision, I will scan many poses of
              myself and others to store them in vector format. These can be
              then loaded on any model for pose referencing.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Midpoint Game:</b> A game where the user will be prompted to
              "guess" the midpoint of an object. These objects could be lines or
              planes.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Degree Game:</b> A game where the user will be prompted to
              "guess" the degree and axis of an ellipse.

          <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
          <p>
            Our parents will always be better than us at many things, but I draw
            the line on a niche board game that most people have never heard of.
          </p>
          <p>
            After recently finishing my Data Structures and Algorithms class, I
            had plenty of graph theory concepts floating around in my head.
            While too complex for what I am willing to write here, my heuristic
            solution to the game was to first create edges between all possible
            combinations of board tiles and then to systematically cull them
            (using a method much like Bellman-Ford) based on some abstract
            properties I defined, such as "neediness".
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of this program was designed on server notepads and used togo
            bags during my free time at my summer restaurant job. While I
            definitely carved my own path with solving this algorithm, some of
            the logic was inspired by
            <a
              href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.07553"
              target="_blank"

              >this paper</a
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            The program was created using python. The program accepts an input
            string of existing tiles (from both the board and your hand) and
            attempts to find the highest number of playable tiles while still
            considering tiles that have not been played yet.

            I had the amazing opportunity to travel to Portugal during the
            winter of 2023. I was hopping from hostel to hostel, meeting
            wonderful people and learning of their stories. Stores are best
            shared around a game of cards, and one of these games originated
            from the

            card deck.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hiki Kabu is one of many games played with the Kabufuda card deck.
            Simple and almost completely luck-based, I knew it was something I
            had to create to memorialize my experience in Portugal, and my love
            for making games.

            This project is sadly unfinished due to time constraints and the
            scope of the project. I want to return to this project one day with
            a simplified and clean approach, but only time will tell.

              >Aggie Data Science Club (A.D.S.C.)</a
            >, my friend Matthew Smith and I partenered up to contend in the
            Kaggle Data competition.
          </p>
          <p>
            This in-house competition rewarded the team with the best regression
            and presentation of the selected data project. In this instance, it
            was the
            <a

              >Microsoft Professional Capstone DataSet</a
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            After much hard work, Matthew and I were able to win the competition
            with our regression and presentation. The concepts we learned from
            A.D.S.C. were invaluable towards our understanding of data science
            and team projects in general.

          <h2>THE PROBLEM</h2>
          <p>My game requires a program for translating a custom conlang.</p>

          <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
          <p>
            I love when games or A.R.G.'s have unique and exciting puzzles that
            lead to rabbit holes. Inspired by the enigmatic Poneglyphs from One
            Piece, the conlang named "Toll Text" was to be used in a now
            canceled final map for the game Garry's Mod.
          </p>
          <p>
            While I still will maintain secrecy about the translation scheme of
            Toll Text, my goal in developing it was to completely rethink how
            constonants and syllables of a language are arranged visually. I
            plan on using the lessons learned from developing Toll Text in
            future projects surrounding my art and writing.

            When you grow up with video games, you'll end up wanting to make
            them. Ever since I began playing Garry's Mod I've had lots of fun
            playing around with varying map making concepts and gameplay
            features.

          <p><i>Some</i> of these games and maps include;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A decades-old telecommunications bunker hosting the remenants of a
              past explorer's escape from society.
            </li>
            <li>
              A concrete jungle populated only by you, a set of puzzles, and an
              eerie breeze that seems to follow you wherever you go.
            </li>
            <li>
              A hommage to the classic Garry's Mod construct style, with
              references to Demazure's work.
            </li>
            <li>
              A movement puzzle shooter combining the best aspects of SUPERHOT
              and Quantum Break.
