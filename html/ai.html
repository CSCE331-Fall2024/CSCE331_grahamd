      <h2>Project Prompt</h2>
      <p>
        I have a class project that requires me to make a singular HTML file
        with AI. This page needs a button to redirect to the home page (with a
        navbar or some other button feature) using:
        <code>href="../index.html"</code>
        This page also needs a section to display this very prompt. Since one of
        my hobbies is art, I would like for you to make a web page about how to
        approach Constructional Drawing. It can cover anything about it, from
        resources, major concepts, popular artists, etc. From this prompt, I
        want:
        <br />1. An HTML file with the requested materials named "ai.html".
        Ensure that a copy of this prompt is somewhere on the page. <br />2. A
        CSS file with styles for this page, named "style_ai.css"

      <h1>Approaching Constructional Drawing</h1>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Constructional drawing is a fundamental technique used by artists to
        build complex forms from simple shapes. It involves breaking down
        objects into basic geometric forms and reconstructing them to create
        accurate and proportionate drawings.
      </p>

      <h2>Major Concepts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Basic Shapes:</strong> Using spheres, cubes, cylinders, and
          cones as building blocks.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Perspective:</strong> Mastering one-point, two-point, and
          three-point perspective to create depth.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Proportion and Scale:</strong> Maintaining correct proportions
          while scaling objects.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Light and Shadow:</strong> Applying shading techniques to give
          form and dimension.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Resources</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://drawabox.com/">Drawabox</a> - A free resource for
          learning the basics of constructional drawing.

      <h2>Popular Artists</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Andrew Loomis:</strong> Known for instructional art books
          focusing on figure drawing and construction.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Kim Jung Gi:</strong> Renowned for his ability to draw complex
          scenes from imagination using construction techniques.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Scott Robertson:</strong> Specializes in drawing and designing
          with an emphasis on industrial and transportation design.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        By mastering constructional drawing, artists can improve their ability
        to draw complex subjects accurately and confidently. It serves as a
        strong foundation for any artistic endeavor.
